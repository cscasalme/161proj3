This project was definitely very interesting, and hopefully you guys continue to use it in future semesters. A great, but also flawed aspect about it was the real world application. A problem was the inconsistency when testing our solutions. Also, a lot of networks were unreliable for this project, including some of the main networks across campus. In terms of understanding, I think the hardest part was understanding the traceroute output and what this function should really return. Maybe there should be mention of using tcpdump in the project spec (although it was on piazza). In terms of effort, my partner and I also would say that the traceroute function was the most difficult to implement.
